Iâ€™ve honed my craft since age 5, playing in many duos, trios, quartets and quintets. I attended California Summer Music for 8 years, serving as a Resident Assistant, Activities Director and Sharpie Awards host in my final year. I also became a prolific program bio writer, four square player and astute listener along the way.
