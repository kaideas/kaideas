<div style="font-size: 1.5em;">Chapter 1: A Beverage of Truth</div>

<p id="first">One Tuesday afternoon in February 2008, <span class="underline" id="starbucks-2">Starbucks</span> closed all of its US stores.</p>

<p>A note posted on 7,100 locked doors explained the reason:</p>

<p>&quot;We're taking time to perfect our <span class="underline" id="espresso">espresso</span>.</p>

<p>Great espresso requires practice.</p>

<p>That's why we're dedicating ourselves to honing our craft.&quot;</p>

<p>Only weeks earlier, I'd sat in my <span class="underline" id="seattle">Seattle</span> office holding back-to-back meetings about how to quickly fix myriad problems that were beginning to surface inside the company. One team had to figure out how we could, in short order, retrain 135,000 baristas to pour the perfect shot of espresso.</p>

<p><span class="underline" id="latte">Pouring espresso is an art</span>, one that requires the barista to care about the quality of the beverage. If the barista only goes through the motions, if he or she does not care and produces an inferior espresso that is too weak or too bitter, then Starbucks has lost the essence of what we set out to do 40 years ago: inspire the human spirit. I realize this is a lofty mission for a cup of coffee, but this is what merchants do. We take the ordinary&mdash;a shoe, a knife&mdash;and give it new life, believing that what we create has the potential to touch others' lives because it touched ours.</p>

<p>Starbucks has always been about so much more than coffee. But without great coffee, we have no reason to exist.</p>

<p>&quot;We looked at all the options,&quot; the team seated around me said. &quot;The only way to retrain everyone by March is to close our stores, all at once.&quot;</p>

<p>I sat back in my chair. It would be a powerful statement, but no retailer had ever done such a thing. &quot;That's a big idea,&quot; I replied, considering the risks. Starbucks would lose several million dollars in sales and labor costs. That would be unavoidable. Competitors would capitalize on our absence and try to lure away our customers. Critics would gloat, cynics would smirk, and the always-unpredictable media scrutiny could be humiliating. On Wall Street, our stock could sink even lower. Most dangerous of all, such a massive retraining event would be perceived as our own admission that Starbucks was no longer good enough. But if I was honest with myself, I knew that that was the truth.</p>

<p>I pursed my lips and looked at the team. &quot;Let's do it.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><br>* * *<br><br></p>

<p>There is a word that comes to my mind when I think about our company and our people. That word is &quot;love.&quot; I love Starbucks because everything we've tried to do is steeped in humanity.</p>

<p>Respect and dignity.</p>

<p>Passion and laughter.</p>

<p>Compassion, community, and responsibility.</p>

<p>Authenticity.</p>

<p>These are Starbucks' touchstones, the source of our pride.</p>

<p>Valuing personal connections at a time when so many people sit alone in front of screens; aspiring to build human relationships in an age when so many issues polarize so many; and acting ethically, even if it costs more, when corners are routinely cut&mdash;these are honorable pursuits, at the core of what we set out to be.</p>

<p>For more than three decades, coffee has captured my imagination because it is a beverage about individuals as well as community. A Rwandan farmer. Eighty roast masters at six Starbucks plants on two continents. Thousands of baristas in 54 countries. Like a symphony, coffee's power rests in the hands of a few individuals who orchestrate its appeal. So much can go wrong during the journey from soil to cup that when everything goes right, it is nothing short of brilliant! After all, coffee doesn't lie. It can't. Every sip is proof of the artistry&mdash;technical as well as human&mdash;that went into its creation.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 2008 I deeply wanted people to fall back in love with Starbucks, which is why, even when bombarded by warnings against it, I decided to close all of our stores across America. I did not feel fear as much as a sense of the unknown, like I was flipping over a playing card. All I had was my belief that, even more than perfecting our coffee, we had to restore the passion and the commitment that everyone at Starbucks needed to have for our customers. Doing so meant taking a step back before we could take many steps forward.</p>
