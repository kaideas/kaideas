<h3>I led Berkeley College to our first Tyng Cup championship in 62 years, improving our residential college intramurals from 10th/12 in 2013 to 1st in 2016 at Yale.</h3>

<h3>This was the result of all-around team play (literally, in 28 sports) and a dedicated marketing push to create an aspirational, faux-intense championship brand, before the on-field product warranted it. Primarily, that meant making the Berkeley Thundercoqs the best-dressed team, while crafting enthusiastic messaging to recruit players in a league where attendance is often the differentiator.</h3>

<h3>For our triumph, I was awarded the Robert E. Lewis Award (for the senior who has shown commitment & high ideals as a participant in intramural sports), the Berkeley College Mead Cup (for a senior who has contributed the most in leadership & service) and the Berkeley College Athletic Prize.</h3>
