I’ve designed and sold apparel for big rival football games (Choate/Deerfield then Yale/Harvard) since 2008. In November 2015, I sold almost 300 sweatshirts to fellow Yale students, taking on zero risk, accepting money on Venmo & Stripe, and exploiting the pro-Yale (not anti-Harvard) market gap, without invasive marketing blasts, all from my dorm room.

I’ve also designed hundreds and sold thousands of other t-shirts (and miscellaneous apparel) for dozens of groups, teams and events, overstuffing my drawers in the process (my philosophy is: why make it if I wouldn’t want to wear it myself?).</h3>
