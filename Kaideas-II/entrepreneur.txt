I’ve designed and sold apparel for big rival football games (Choate/Deerfield then Yale/Harvard) since 2008. </h3>

<h3>
In the beginning, I ordered in advance of payments, accepted loose cash and kept track of orders on scrap paper. In November 2015, I sold almost 300 sweatshirts to fellow Yale students, taking on zero risk, accepting money on Venmo & Stripe, and exploiting the pro-Yale (not anti-Harvard) market gap, without invasive marketing blasts, out of my dorm room.
</h3>

<h3>
I’ve also designed hundreds and sold thousands of other t-shirts (and miscellaneous apparel) for dozens of groups, teams and events, and overstuffing my drawers (my philosophy is: why make it if I wouldn’t want to wear it myself?).
