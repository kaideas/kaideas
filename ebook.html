		The new cafe at 1802 Hillhurst Avenue looked familiar, but something was off. It was nestled into a strip mall in Los Feliz, on the east side of <span class="underline" id="la">Los Angeles</span>, and its logo was a double-tailed mermaid, rendered in black and green, wearing a crown and a smile. Its name, spelled out in blocky white letters, was recognizable, too, except for a blunt détournement up top: DUMB <span class="underline" id="starbucks">STARBUCKS COFFEE</span>. The store was the creation of Nathan Fielder, a <span class="underline" id="canadian">Canadian-born comedian</span>, and he designed it to look exactly like an outpost of the ubiquitous coffee chain — that is, until you realized that the word “dumb” was everywhere. The menu listed 27 beverages with names like Dumb Iced Caramel Macchiato and Dumb Chai Tea Latte. Cups came in sizes from Dumb Tall to Dumb Venti. Two baristas manned the counter, with DUMB STARBUCKS COFFEE emblazoned on their green aprons. “I hired them on <span class="underline" id="craigslist">Craigslist</span>,” Fielder told me recently. “The ad actually asked for people who worked at Starbucks before, so we wouldn’t have to train them.” A rack of easy-listening CDs kept to the theme: “Dumb Jazz Standards,” “Dumb Norah Jones Duets.” The cafe quietly opened for business on a Friday last February. “I didn’t expect things to get as crazy as they did,” Fielder said.

</p>

<p>
As the weekend progressed, the mysterious new shop somehow became a minor cultural event. The coffee was by most accounts mediocre, but by Saturday afternoon the line spilled out the front door, past an adjoining Laundromat and up the street. People reported wait times exceeding two hours; others made special trips to snap selfies out front, posting these to Instagram and Twitter. News outlets filed amusedly perplexed stories as hypotheses about the store’s origins proliferated: Forbes posted an essay online arguing that the cafe was the handiwork of Banksy, the enigmatic British artist known for his anticapitalist provocations. Dumb Starbucks cups hit eBay for as much as $500, and a guy began hawking bootleg Dumb Starbucks trucker caps in the parking lot, alongside indie bands giving impromptu performances and a group opposed to plastic waste, which organized a protest. USA Today contacted Starbucks, which offered no insight beyond asserting that the cafe was infringing on its protected trademark. On Monday, 72 hours after the store opened, Fielder finally gave a news conference, in which he identified himself as the proprietor of what he called an “independent coffee shop.” Dumb Starbucks was no joke, he claimed, but an earnest operation, meant to make money. Unfortunately, officers from the department of health were on site and determined that Fielder’s permits weren’t in order. By sundown, Dumb Starbucks was dead.
</p>

<p>
Two months later, Fielder, who is 31, was at his office in Hollywood, in good spirits despite his startup’s demise. Clean-cut and boyish, with dark hair, dark eyes and a slightly stilted bearing, he calls to mind a Jewish Anthony Perkins. Sitting under fluorescent lights and a drop ceiling, he described Dumb Starbucks as a multilayered and dissembling work of satire — a spoof of a spoof of a spoof. By weaving the word “dumb” throughout his knockoff Starbucks, he claimed, he satisfied the minimum legal requirement for parody, allowing himself to cash in, with impunity, on Starbucks’s globally recognizable name. “People had responded to it as an anticorporate thing, and when I did that news conference, I think they were disappointed,” he said. “Because I was like, ‘No, this was just purely to make money.’ Which is a totally corporate mentality: We found a loophole to make more money. That made it so much more funny.”
</p>

<p>
Fielder has performed as a stand-up comic and in improv groups, but his best jokes take shape as elaborate schemes that unfold out in the world — delighting, bewildering and occasionally antagonizing people who are only dimly aware, if they’re aware at all, that a ruse is afoot. His vehicle for these schemes is “Nathan for You,” a reality show on Comedy Central whose second season will have its debut on July 1, and in which Fielder, acting as a business consultant, persuades small concerns to adopt preposterous, yet strangely ingenious, marketing strategies. Fielder explained that, in the context of the show, Dumb Starbucks was an attempt at highly creative profiteering, masquerading as subversive critique: “You go by a new coffee shop, they have no brand recognition, no brand,” he said. “But anytime you pass a Starbucks, it’s automatically full.” The parody-law conceit offered him “a workaround — a legal way to use their brand, which is guaranteed to fill the store.”
</p>

<p>
‘People had responded to Dumb Starbucks as an anticorporate thing, and when I did that news conference, I think they were disappointed. Because I was like, ‘‘No, this was just purely to make money.’’ . . . That made it so much more funny.’
</p>

<p>
Fielder has a bachelor’s degree in commerce from the University of Victoria in British Columbia, and on camera he continues a tradition of mischievous comedic personas that includes Sacha Baron Cohen and Stephen Colbert, by playing an exaggerated version of the guy his education groomed him to become: a relentless conniver, dead set on juicing sales for his clients without regard for ethics, much less common sense. In the pilot, Fielder set the tone, persuading Yogurt Haven, a frozen-yogurt shop in Eagle Rock, Calif., to offer a special “poo flavor,” on the assumption that it would attract the curious in droves. The idea didn’t pan out, but watching Fielder methodically develop the dessert at a flavoring company, and watching customers taste the stuff, was fun.
</p>

<p>
One wonder of “Nathan for You” is that such sophomoric premises can take richly unexpected turns. In Fielder’s favorite Season 1 episode, he got a Burbank gas-station proprietor to charge just $1.75 a gallon, but only for customers who climbed to the top of a distant mountain, answered a series of riddles and deposited a rebate form into a drop box hidden in the brush. On the day of shooting, about a half-dozen customers agreed to this challenge, so Fielder piled them into a van and brought along tents and a guitar for campfire songs: The episode morphed into an improbably touching travelogue about lonely people, Fielder included, with an excess of time and patience.
</p>
<p>
Tacked to corkboard above Fielder’s desk there was an array of index cards that he was using to map out the order of his show’s coming season. In a vote of confidence, the network ordered 10 episodes, but Fielder, who directs, co-writes and stars in the show, asked them to reduce the number to a more manageable eight. “Maybe that was stupid, because I get paid per episode,” Fielder said. “But it takes a long time to make the show, and I just want to execute it well.” He said that the network’s marketing department suggested leading off with the Dumb Starbucks episode, capitalizing on the buzz the cafe had generated. But Fielder, worried about overdoing it, was resistant. “My focus is on creating an enjoyable season,” he said, “and I think a lot less about what would serve ratings.”
</p>

<p>
This was something that Fielder would never utter, of course, in his on-screen guise. Although he once seriously considered a career in business, that world and its preoccupations have long struck him as ripe for laughs. A moral streak, however submerged and slippery, inflects his show, which serves as both a loving tribute to scrappy entrepreneurial gumption and an offbeat assault on the way such gumption can curdle into predatory greed. With “Nathan for You,” Fielder said, the joke is that he inhabits that unscrupulous mentality to a near-sociopathic extreme: “It’s funny to lean into that idea of: ‘How can we push product? How can we sell stuff?’ without thinking any more broadly about what you’re doing and how it benefits the world.”
</p>

<p>

On Fielder’s desk there was an odd-looking toy, composed of a fuzzy halo of webbed coronets sprouting from a central hub. “It’s basically a worse ball,” Fielder said. “It doesn’t go as far or bounce as high, and it’s hard to catch.” The toy was called a Doinkit, and for a coming episode of “Nathan for You,” Fielder had offered his services to its manufacturer, Marky Sparky Toys, experimenting with a marketing campaign that preyed crassly on the insecurities of the target demographic: young children. Owning a Doinkit, Fielder’s copy asserted, is the only way to prove you’re not a baby. This bullying message would unfold in various forms, from packaging that Fielder designed (a Doinkitless child of about 6 slumps dejectedly in diapers while others mock him), to a hectoring television commercial, to a mall Santa instructed to give kids the hard sell: “You aren’t a baby, are you?” The subtext was that advertising is designed to make people of all ages feel inadequate and incomplete; Fielder, whose wife is a children’s librarian, wanted to know what it would look like if he applied that logic coldly and rigorously to first graders. (Fielder likes incorporating children into the show, framing his character’s perversity against their innocence.)
</p>

<p>
Around 10 a.m., Michael Koman, co-creator of “Nathan for You,” arrived at the office. Koman’s résumé includes writing positions on “Late Night With Conan O’Brien” and “The Colbert Report.” He and Fielder walked to a room down the hall, where an editor named Eric Notarnicola was stitching together a provisional cut of the Doinkit segment. “It’s basically selling children an identity, the same way you sell adults a Lexus,” Koman said.
</p>

<p>
Many people suspect that reality television is scripted, and with “Nathan for You,” this is, in a sense, the case. Fielder and his writers compose detailed outlines for each episode, trying their best to predict “what a reasonable person might say in a situation,” Fielder said, and to steer events in propitious directions — nudging customers from the gas station, for example, to the mountaintop. This doesn’t mean that the show’s marks are acting, however, or in on the joke: Fielder’s producers approach prospective businesses without letting on that “Nathan for You” is a comedy show, and Fielder never breaks character at a shoot. He avoids going big with his performance, which helps him to pivot nimbly from laugh-getter to straight man, depending on how his interlocutors react to whatever crazy idea he’s selling. In one episode, Fielder proposes that a delicatessen manager named Gloria allow noncustomers to use her restrooms and that she advertise this policy around the neighborhood, arguing that the increased foot traffic will be worth it. Fielder presents his pitch with winning enthusiasm, and with an air of soft-spoken naïveté that helps smooth away any underlying meanness in the moment: “You guys could become the neighborhood toilet,” he tells her. Gloria glances around as if for help, but Fielder simply lets her discomfort hang in the air. Finally, politeness gets the better of Gloria’s judgment, and she says, “Yeah, I guess that’s a good idea.”
</p>

<p>
In filming the show, Fielder says, chance ultimately rules: “We don’t even reference the script after a certain point. An entire day of shooting will ride on stuff happening the way we hope. It’s crazy to do a production like that, but the uncertainty makes the show feel more authentic and spontaneous.” Koman agreed: “It’s setups and luck.” The way Fielder manages this unpredictability is to shoot an excess of footage: He may need only one kid sitting on Santa’s lap with a Doinkit, but he’ll film three to ensure that he’s covered. “This show shoots more footage than anything I’ve worked on,” Notarnicola said, sitting at his editing bay. Fielder said, “Only a few things keep making you laugh the 10th, 12th, 15th time you watch them, though, so it gets easier to cut as you go.”
</p>

<p>
Notarnicola dialed up footage from a focus group composed of Fielder and three young children. “This is me testing out whether the pitch will work and get kids to want the toy,” Fielder explained. On-screen, in a tie and ill-fitting button-down shirt, Fielder held a Doinkit and quizzed his prepubescent panel. “When I show this to you, what do you think? Do you want it?”
</p>

<p>
The kids were unmoved. “Duuumb,” one said.
</p>

<p>
In one episode, Fielder races to free himself from handcuffs before a robot arm undoes his pants in front of an audience of children — while an L.A.P.D. officer stands by to arrest him if necessary for indecent exposure.
</p>

<p>
Fielder pretended to get a phone call. “Hello? Oh, yes, sir. Really? Oh, my God, I’ll let them know.” He hung up and addressed the kids again. “Sorry, guys. That was the governor, and he just told me that owning this toy is now the only proof you’re not a baby. I mean, I have one, so that’s good. I see you guys don’t have the toy. Are you babies?”
</p>

<p>
Two kids quickly grabbed Doinkits from the table. The third, a girl, briefly resisted before succumbing with evident unease.
</p>

<p>
“What do you feel inside right now?” Fielder asked her.
</p>

<p>
“I don’t feel anything,” she replied, holding her Doinkit despondently.
</p>

<p>
Fielder and Koman cracked up. The moment was funny, but sad too, and even though they were laughing at the coercive setup rather than at the little girl’s unhappiness, it was wincingly difficult to separate the two.
</p>

<p>
“Maybe we end the scene on her line?” Notarnicola suggested.
</p>

<p>
“Yeah,” Fielder replied, grinning.
</p>

<p>
As a kid in his native Vancouver, the son of two social workers, Fielder would borrow the Dictaphone his mother used for work and record the opening stand-up routines from “Seinfeld,” transcribing and memorizing them. “I’d rewind it, listen to it, rewind it,” he recalls. “I was obsessive about comedy.” Fielder liked performing from a young age, writing scripts for imaginary sitcoms with his friends, acting in musical theater at school and falling in love with magic. “I started when I was 13,” he said. “I worked at a magic shop, I’d do shows at children’s birthdays, and I’d walk around at parties doing card tricks.” In 10th grade, at Point Grey Secondary School, he joined a student improv-comedy troupe, the luminary of which was a burly older kid named Seth Rogen. “He had this deadpan, dry delivery; he was very precise,” Rogen told me, recalling Fielder’s performing style. “He wouldn’t say anything, then he’d come in at the end with a line that killed — a joke that changed the whole scene or escalated it.”
</p>

<p>

From adolescence through his early 20s, Fielder suffered from anxiety or, as he put it, the near-constant “fear of a disaster interaction.” This manifested most acutely with women. “How do you tell a girl you like her?” he asked. “Or kiss her? Or anything without her being repulsed or saying no? In a lot of social situations, I understood what was going on but tried to remove myself from it, because it was too painful to exist in.” He enjoyed performing for audiences because this allowed him to exert substantial control over an asymmetrical exchange. As a magician, he said: “You get people coming to you. ‘Can I see a trick?’ And after you do a trick well, people are interested and fascinated. It’s this thing where you hold a secret.”
</p>

<p>

In college, Fielder studied entrepreneurship and marketing, but his heart wasn’t in it. “I used to trade stocks online,” he recalls, “and I kind of felt gross, like, all I’m doing is making money off other people’s creativity, and I’m not creating anything myself.” He performed stand-up, dispensing cerebral one-liners, and began shooting comedic shorts with friends. These led to a job on “Canadian Idol,” where he helped write humorous segments and interviewed contestants. In 2007, having improved in his rapport with women, he met the woman who would become his wife at a mutual friend’s comedy performance. He was working by this time as a correspondent on “This Hour Has 22 Minutes,” a long-running weekly Canadian comedy series similar to “The Daily Show.” Fielder filed short dispatches from the field, taking an ostensible consumer-utility angle (“What should you look out for when purchasing an MP3 player?”) as an excuse for absurdist encounters with a motley procession of audio-equipment salespeople, sleep researchers and animal communicators.
</p>

<p>

Fielder gradually honed his awkwardness as a comedic weapon. “I embraced that weird part of me,” he said. “Like, right now, I don’t want there to be awkwardness between us, and I want you to be comfortable, but it takes effort for me to do that. In the show, I’ll just let uncomfortable moments happen.” He once came across a conversation about him on a message board devoted to Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism, in which the participants discussed ways in which Fielder’s off-kilter comedic style tracked with symptoms of the disorder. Intrigued, Fielder researched Asperger’s and took a degree of inspiration from it. “Usually if someone gives you a social cue that he feels uncomfortable with something you’ve said, you’ll jump in with a caveat and move on. Everyone’s default state is this pleasantry state. My goal in the show is to undercut that as quickly as possible. If you really do let it sit, it’s sometimes amazing what comes out of people.”
</p>

<p>

Fielder is motivated by a less biting, more oblique sense of humor than forebears like Baron Cohen (a “Nathan for You” fan), who often set out to expose idiocy and hypocrisy in their unwitting interview subjects. “The goal of the show isn’t making fun of this person for being dumb or ignorant,” Fielder said. When, during a forthcoming episode, a real-estate broker reveals to Fielder that she was once sexually assaulted by a ghost, the moment is disconcerting, but Fielder doesn’t play it mockingly.
</p>

</p>

<p>

In conversation, Fielder speaks not of perpetrating pranks but rather of conducting “social experiments” — he’s less interested in “Candid Camera"-style gotchas than in spinning strange fictions and seeing what they provoke. He has orchestrated mass charades via Twitter, instructing his followers to, for example, use text messages to fool their parents into believing that their children are drug dealers, retweeting the range of reactions. Time and again, he has demonstrated his gift for engineering viral phenomena. While shooting the first season of “Nathan for You,” in a segment about promoting a petting zoo, Fielder faked a grainy smartphone video in which a pig appears to save a baby goat from drowning in a pond. The joke was not merely that he staged it, but that he went to highly involved lengths to do so: trucking in a professional stunt pig, hiring scuba-diving animal wranglers, building a curvy plastic corridor beneath the surface of the water. Fielder uploaded his 29-second clip anonymously, and within days it was featured on Gawker, “Good Morning America,” “Today,” “Fox News” and “NBC Nightly News.” That the video was a hoax wasn’t revealed for five months, when “Nathan for You” took to the air, by which point the clip had more than seven million views on YouTube. Today the count is 8.3 million.
</p>

<p>

After a day of editing and sound mixing, Fielder drove to the Magic Castle, a members-only magic club in Hollywood. The Castle, which occupies a mansion built in 1909, has an ambience of idiosyncratic austerity: It imposes a strict dress code on visitors, albeit one in which acceptable neckwear for men includes “turtlenecks (that can be folded over), bolo ties, ascots, jeweled collars, ruffled collars and banded collars.” Fielder says that one of the first things he did upon moving to Los Angeles was to secure a membership. “I’m always bringing people here, hoping they fall in love with magic,” he said as we entered through a door disguised as a bookcase, “because I think it has a bad rap.”
</p>

<p>

Magicians were scattered throughout the place — some in tiny rooms, others in largish theaters decorated with plush carpets and ornately carved wood. Fielder ordered himself a beer as we tried to figure out where to go first. “Did you see the last David Blaine special?” he asked. “He reinvented himself. His magic had been getting more epic, and less good. But here, it was long takes of close-up tricks, and I couldn’t figure out how he did anything.” Fielder contrasted this, unfavorably, with a recent program featuring Criss Angel, the frequently shirtless Vegas illusionist: “It kept fast-forwarding through the setup for each trick, which is the best part!” “Nathan for You” featured its own warped homage to Houdini-style spectacle during a Season 1 episode, in which Fielder raced to free himself from handcuffs before a robot arm undid his pants in front of an audience of children — while an L.A.P.D. officer stood by to arrest him if necessary for indecent exposure.
</p>

<p>

Fielder likes magic for much the same reason that he likes comedy: its power to pull spectators in and knock them off balance. (This is doubtless why the two forms are often intertwined.) The difference, he noted, was that in magic, a middling performer “can have a repulsive personality as long as the tricks work, because of the wow factor. In comedy, there isn’t that crutch. If you’re not likable on some level, no one will laugh.” We entered a tiny room called the Close-up Gallery, where a young magician from New York soon took the stage to a throbbing Flo-Rida song. The act was bumpy: The magician fumbled props and seemed rushed in his banter. The crowd gamely applauded each beat, but Fielder kept his hands on his knees, watching impassively.
</p>

<p>
“Sometimes you come here,” Fielder said afterward, as we headed upstairs to see another act, “and the magic isn’t very good: The performer’s a bit sloppy, you’re aware of all the moves, he’s doing stuff you’ve seen before, maybe he plays really loud pop songs.” Fielder smiled and shook his head. But he kept coming nonetheless, in the hope of stumbling into a sublime hoodwinking. “There are times when you find someone who does something so new that you’re not thinking about the moves anymore,” Fielder said. “You’re just blown away, and you’ve got no idea what the hell just happened.”
